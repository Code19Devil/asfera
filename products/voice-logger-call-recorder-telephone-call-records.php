    <div class="col-sm-12 col-lg-12 wow fadeInUp">
      <h5 class="text-left normal-text">A voice logger is a gadget or software program that records audio from telephones, radios, microphones, and other
        sources and saves it to a computer's hard drive or portable media. A voice loggers system is a precious items tool for recording
        interactions between call center agents, supervisors, and managers on the one hand and prospects, leads, or customers on the other.
        A voice logger is an essential component of any communication system and may store data in various formats. </h5>
      <h5 class="text-left normal-text mt-4  wow fadeInUp">It seems like the developers of Voice Logger had difficulty coming up with a decent user interface - I mean, seriously,
        I think it's time for them to update the design. There are far too many high-tech-sounding terms for something that should be simple to use,
        plus it seemed like they ran out of ways to name the buttons. But for now, this is what I have to work with. The first thing you'll need to do is to
        select the input source - either computer, phone, or sound card. I can't figure out if there's a way to choose the output option, but I'll try to find
        out later if someone else doesn't beat me to</h5>
